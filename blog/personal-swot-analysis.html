    <h1>Personal SWOT Analysis</h1>
    <hr>
    <article>
      <p>
        A SWOT analysis is a tool used to assess a business, project, or individual by looking at four key areas: Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats.
        A SWOT analysis helps you understand what you're doing well, what needs improvement, what opportunities you can pursue, and what risks to watch out for.
      </p>
      <h2>Strenghts</h2>
      <p>
        My strengths are that im very good at learning, school wise looking I always got great marks.
        And that i am quite commited to something when i start with it.
        Im also very creative and well behaved according teachers and parents.
      </p>
      <h2>Weaknessess</h2>
      <p>
        My weaknesses would be my lack of socail skills and that im dyslexic so spelling isn't easy for me.
      </p>
      <h2>Opportunities</h2>
      <p>
        So right now i already took one of the opportunities i saw, for summer job im work in a IT company 2 days a week. I need to finishs a website for them and help around where is needed.
        Furthermore my dad and older sister are both working in the IT so they could help me in this study.
      </p>
      <h2>Threats</h2>
      <p>
        I feel like i dont have many threats, the things that could be threats i mentioned them in weaknesses. 
        Ig a threat of mine could be that i might not have the perfect laptop for this study (but im trying to fix this)
