        <h1>First Feedback</h1>

          <h2>Feedback Pitch day</h2>
          <p>The feedback I recieved in short: to change the way my dashboard works, to add more faqs for the design,
            blogpost add name, a return button for the blogs, to add a footer and too make the whole blog items clickable.
          </p>
          <h1>What I did with it:</h1>
          <p>
            To change the way my dashboard works, I did what was asked cuz it was a totally fair feedback since I misunderstood how the EC system worked.
          </p>
          <p>To add more faqs for the design, the reason why the page needed more faqs was so that I could add the star design that would look weird if it had less faqs</p>
          <p>Blogpost add name, I made a simple mistake by forgetting to add my name on the blogs and a teacher assistent spotted it so i fixed it now.</p>
          <p>A return button for the blogs, I didnt add this feedback to my website because then I would have two buttons that do the same thing on the same page,
            and I found that unnecessary and was afraid it would ruin the design.</p>
          <p>To add a footer, since it was suggested i added one, though it doesnt really add much value in my oppionin.</p>
          <p>the whole blog items clickable, this was another change that was kinda really needed since its much easier,
            than only being able to click on the titel, so I implemented this feedback.</p>
          <h2>Final feedback</h2>
          <p>
            At PCO graded assessments with Paula, I recieved the last bits of feedback.
            The feedback was seprate javascript file, create multiple css files and try to shorten the css code.
            With the feedback I also got the reason behind the feedback which I agreed with so also implemented it on my website.
            Its smart to have seprate javascript file because then the future maintainer can see more easily that javascript was used on the website.
            It also helps to find the javascript and make the dashboard html file easier to read.
            By creating multiple css files it avoids loading unnecessary code. And with making the css shorter its easier to change certain things on the website and way easier to find things.
