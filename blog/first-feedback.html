          <h2>Feedback Pitch day</h2>
          <p>The feedback I recieved in short: to change the way my dashboard works, to add more faqs for the design,
            blogpost add name, a return button for the blogs, to add a footer and too make the whole blog items clickable.
          </p>
          <h1>What I did with it:</h1>
          <p>
            To change the way my dashboard works, I did what was asked cuz it was a totally fair feedback since I misunderstood how the EC system worked.
          </p>
          <p>To add more faqs for the design, the reason why the page needed more faqs was so that I could add the star design that would look weird if it had less faqs</p>
          <p>Blogpost add name, I made a simple mistake by forgetting to add my name on the blogs and a teacher assistent spotted it so i fixed it now.</p>
          <p>A return button for the blogs, I didnt add this feedback to my website because then I would have two buttons that do the same thing on the same page,
            and I found that unnecessary and was afraid it would ruin the design.</p>
          <p>To add a footer, since it was suggested i added one, though it doesnt really add much value in my oppionin.</p>
          <p>the whole blog items clickable, this was another change that was kinda really needed since its much easier,
            than only being able to click on the titel, so I implemented this feedback.</p>
          <h1>The rest of the feedback has yet to be recieved,
             so for the time being this is it.</h1>
