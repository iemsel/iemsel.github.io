          I chose to study HBO-ICT at HZ for several reasons. First, it's close enough to my home, so I don't have to move into student housing, which is convenient for me.
          Also, a few of my friends have chosen HZ as well, so it is nice to have familiar faces around.
          The program itself is very interesting and aligns with my passion for ICT, which has been influenced by my family is background in the field, 
          especially my dad's work as a programmer. Additionally, HZ offers an international class, which I find appealing because it allows me to connect with people from different cultures and learn in a global context.
          Further more i also did bilingual eduction on my previous school,
          and i was able to pass the cambridge exam with C1 level.
