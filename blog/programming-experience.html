    <h1>Programming Experience</h1>
    <hr>
    <article>
      <p>
        My experience programming, when I was still a kid,
        my dad let me watch him do his job and there he tried to explain some codes but I was too small to understand.
        When I was in primary school I went to a programming class one time,
        back then I didnt have any interest in what I was doing in that class.
        Though these two experiences where from when I was really young I still count them as experiences since I
        learned from them.
      </p>
      <p>
        My real experience programming started in middle school, the first year.
        In my first year i had a class called O and T, which stands for "Onderzoek en Techniek".
        In this class we learned basic things how the computer works like how to save files, how excel works,
        and craftwork the first year.
        I had this class also 2nd and 3rd year and then we learned how to program with microbits and turtle in python.
        I preformed very good in this class and also enjoyed it, so I choose Informatica for the 4th and 5th year.
      </p>
      <p>
        Informatica was great aswell I learned so many things and had fun projects.
        My experience grew the most in informatica, I learned how to make the base of a website,
        binaire, flowgorithm, python, databases (SQL-Light), how to make a app with guizero and so much more.
        My favourite experience from this class was making a website that tells the weather and
        making my own game, which worked so good that I played it lots with friends even outside school.
        On the home page there are pictures of my website that I made that tells the weather.
        Below this text is a picture of my app that I made.
      </p>

        <p class="rightText">
          This game was a group project, I did all the coding and my friend did the documents and user experience reports.
          You start the game by choosing one of the list or fill in 8 words and then click submit.
          Once submited a window will pop up asking you to pick a number between 1 and 20,
          after you selected the number you click submit again then the window closes and
          you have to select a symbool, once you selected a symbool and press sumbit again you get your result.
          The result can be one of the random words you filled in or one of the words of the lists that you selected.
          This game is basicly the online version of the paper game!

        Lastly I had a vacation job in the ICT Field This summer (2024),
        thanks because of my sister I was able to work on a website for the company Progression.
        I learned there a bit how to work with wordpress, xampp and how to install windows on computers.
        This is all my experience in the ICT field when im not counting the small extra things like adding/mantaining
        mods in games.
