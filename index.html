      <h1>Why HBO-ICT is something for me</h1>
      <p>I chose ICT because my family has experience in it,
         which sparked my interest in the field. 
         My dad works at Dow in Terneuzen as a programmer,
         and he got me interested in computers and games.
         Furthermore, at my previous school, we had a subject called "Informatica,"
         which is similar to ICT, but ICT is broader in scope.
         I really enjoyed that subject and was quite good at it.

         I also gained some experience in the ICT field thanks to my older sister,
         who offered me a vacation job at the company where she works.
         I had to build a website there,
         and I enjoyed solving problems around the officeâ€”especially when I was actually able to fix them!
         With this experience and my growing interest in ICT,
          I believe that HBO-ICT is the right path for me.
      </p>
      <p>All my experience in ICT Field:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Informatica as subject in middle school</li>
        <li>Vacation job in the ICT Field</li>
        <li>Minecraft mods</li>
        <li>Creating roblox games</li>
      </ul>
      <p id="website-text">
        For Informatica, I had to create a website at one point as well; this was two years ago.
        When you compare this website to the one I built back then,
        you will see a great difference, which shows my development.
        The website is shown in the images below.

        The goal of that website was to display the upcoming weather, similar to "Buienradar."
        It was a group project of two, where we divided the work: my partner would write the documents,
        and I would create the website.
        The website had both light and dark modes, and I designed it entirely on my own.
