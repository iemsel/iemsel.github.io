    <h1>Why HBO-ICT is something for me</h1>
    <p>I chose to study ICT because it connects with both my personal interests and my family background.
      My dad works as a programmer at Dow in Terneuzen, and growing up,
      I was always curious about the work he did with computers.
      Seeing him solve problems and create solutions inspired me,
      and I can easily see myself following a similar path.
      His passion for programming, combined with how he handled challenges, really got me interested in ICT.

      At my previous school, I took a subject called "Informatica,"
      which is similar to ICT but more focused. I enjoyed that subject a lot and was good at it,
      which confirmed my interest in the field.
      Learning about how computers work and figuring out ways to fix or improve systems was something that excited me.
    </p>
    <p>  
      I also gained some hands-on experience thanks to my older sister,
      who got me a vacation job at her company. One of my tasks was building a website,
      and I really enjoyed solving problems around the office.
      Being able to fix issues and help others gave me a real sense of accomplishment.
      The process of finding solutions and making things work is something I find very satisfying.
      
      With these experiences and my growing interest in ICT, I believe HBO-ICT is the right path for me.
      I enjoy the challenge of solving problems and learning new things, and I can see myself working in a job like my dad's,
      where I can apply my skills to help others and create useful solutions.
      Solving problems gives me a real sense of achievement, and that is why I am excited about pursuing a career in ICT.

    <h1>Informatica (from my old school)</h1>
    <p>
      For Informatica, I had to create a website at one point as well; this was two years ago.
      When you compare this website to the one I built back then,
      you will see a great difference, which shows my development.
      The website is shown in the images below.

      The goal of that website was to display the upcoming weather, similar to "Buienradar."
      It was a group project of two, where we divided the work: my partner would write the documents,
      and I would create the website.
      The website had both light and dark modes, and I designed it entirely on my own.
