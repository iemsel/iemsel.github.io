        <p id="mochi">Hello! so im Naimi de Jong, im a first year student at HZ HBO-ICT.
           Here are a few things about myself,
           I'm from the Netherlands, Zeeland, Axel.
          I enjoy gaming, drawing and taking care of my rabbits.
          I'm a anime fan, I have watched Haikyuu, Tokyo Revengers, HxH, sk8 infity and many more.
          I play the games: Roblox, Gesnhin Impact, Valorant, Minecraft.
          Gaming has been my hobby since the first time I got an electronic device.
          Started with a tablet that was worth not much and
          right now i have 2 tablets, 1 phone, 1 pc and 1 laptop.
          I like to draw anime related things, in a different style.
          I'm able to draw on computer with mouse, on a drawing tablet and ofcourse on paper.
          Online im know as iemsel, because thats a nickname I got at primary school.
          At the moment (Sept 2024) i have 20 rabbits,
          one of my favourite is Mochi.
          We had to bottle feed her by hand and she is just the sweetest thing ever.
          Right below this text you can see 3 pictures of my bunny Mochi!
